Why is this needed?
when we decode tokens back to text, we need to know what each token ID represents. 
As we merge pairs, new tokens are formed 
token 256 might be b'e ' (e + whitespace)

#Why are we saving the tokenizer?
'''
So that we can use the same tokenizer for: 
1. Training the model -> convert Wikipedia text to tokens
2. Testing the model -> encode prompts and decode generated text
3. Future use

Pickle is a way of saving Python objects to disk 
It serializes(saves) dictionaries, lists and other data structures. 

It can also be saves using JSON but that cannot handle bytes easily. 
Without saving, we need to train the tokenizer every time we need to use it.

with open('tokenizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(tokenizer_data, f)

'''
Note, the Tokenizer is a completely separate, independent module from the LLM. 
It has its own training dataset of text (which could be different from that of the LLM), 
on which you train the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm. 
It then translates back and forth between raw text and sequences of tokens. 
The LLM later only ever sees the tokens and never directly deals with any text.

Order - 

LLM 
token sequence
tokenizer
raw tokens

The LLM only interacts with the token sequence which is given by the tokenizer
'''
#NOTE - Now, we have created the merges and added them into the vocabulary. The size of the tokens is less, but the size of 
#vocabulary has been increased.

#Next step is Encoding and Decoding 
'''
Why do we have to do this?

Encode = text -> numbers
Decode = numbers -> text 

to make the model understand the prompts, we need to encode our text into numbers.
and the output of the model will also be in numbers. For us to understand, we need to decode it back to text.

TRACING 

suppose text = Hello

tokens = list(text.encode("utf-8"))
text.encode("utf-8") = b'Hello'
list(b'Hello') = [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]

while len(tokens) >= 2: -> we keep merging as long as there are at least 2 tokens

    stats = get_stats(tokens)
    -> merging => 
    stats = {
        (72, 101) : 1
        (101, 108) : 1
        (108, 108) : 1
        (108, 111) : 1
    }

    pair = min(stats, key = lambda p: merges.get(p, float("-inf")))

    merges.get(p, float("-inf")) means, if p exists in merges, then get the token ID of p(256, 257, etc), basically the value of the key
    or else return float("-inf")
    
    merges dictonary looks something like this -> 

    merges = {
    (101, 32): 256,   # "e " was merged first  (priority 256)
    (116, 104): 257,  # "th" was merged second (priority 257)
    (105, 110): 258,  # "in" was merged third  (priority 258)
    ...

TRACING - 

ids = [72, 101, 257]

vocab = {
    72 : b'H',
    101 : b'e',
    257 : b'llo'
}

for idx in ids -> loop through each idx in ids 

vocab[idx] = 

vocab[72] = b'H'
vocab[101] = b'e'
vocab[257] = b'llo'

b"".join(..) -> concatenate all the bytes together

=> b'H' + b'e' + b'llo' -> b'Hello'

tokens = b'Hello'

text = tokens.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")
This line converts byte to text(string)

.decode("utf-8") -> converts bytes to text using utf-8 encoding, meaning -> 
b'Hello' = 'Hello'

errors="replace" - If there are invalid UTF-8 bytes, replace them with ï¿½ instead of crashing

so now, text = Hello is a readable string.

NOTE: 
just because we are using .decode(), doesn't mean it is a recursion function. 
It calls the built-in .decode() method on a byte string
